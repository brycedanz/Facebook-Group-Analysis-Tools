-No solicitation or mass selling of products (Cutco, Mary Kay, etc.)
-No animals. It has been brought to my attention numerous times there is a problem with animal abuse in Whatcom County, and giving away/selling animals on forums like this leaves doors open for it to happen.

"In traditional Chinese herbalism, pu-erh tea is considered to open the meridians, 'warm the middle burner' (the spleen and stomach) and be beneficial to 'blood cleansing' and digestion. For these reasons, it is often consumed after heavy meals or drunk as a hangover cure / preventative.

Some studies have shown that pu-erh may lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure and increase metabolism. Pu-erh is occasionally touted as a 'diet tea,' but like all teas, I don't recommend consuming it as a magical weight loss tool, but rather as an enjoyable part of a healthy diet."

"Sad to part with this incredible  bed :( but its time for me to upgrade! 

This is an awesome twin bunk bed ! What's great is that it has 3 bunking level options ! I sported the high ground level so I could shove all my Extra crap under the bed and have canopy like curtains enclosing it! But it can also be ground low and ceiling high levels!

 I have a ladder that comes with it and also ill throw in the mattress as part of the package! Don't worry it's a clean comfy mattress! No bed bugs or stains!!!

 Also I do have an incredible 3"" memory foam topper that I am selling separately!

 I am asking 200$ for the bunk bed combo and 80$ for the memory foam! I am willing to negotiate:)!!! 

The proceeds are going toward my new bed so every penny counts! Message for more details!"	"2014-06-08T01:20:57+0000"	"Haley N. Douglas"

Happening this weekend at Cedar Mountain Herbs in Mount Vernon:

Interested in digestive health or fermentation? Think it may be time to heal your gut but you don't know where to start, have questions or cannot sift through all the information on your own? Come to the Herb School this Sunday from 12-5:30p and take the journey through fermentation with us!

A whooping 70% of our immune activity occurs in our small intestine. Our moods and level of stress affect our immune system, but did you realize 80% of our relaxing neurotransmitters reside in our small intestine?

If we nourish and heal our gut, the benefits to our emotional/nervous and immune systems are many fold. We may increase our ability to deal with day to day stresses easier, and have a higher stress threshold to cope with larger, more intense stresses such as transition, grief, and loss. Other possible positive results are deeper, more restful sleep, better uptake of nutrition from the foods we eat, and a healthier, heartier immune system.

The cost of this class is $75, you can register online here http://www.eventzilla.net/web/event?eventid=2139000908

You will learn about soaking nuts and grains (and make a delicious baked breakfast treat), bone broths (and how to make them), Water kefir, Lacto-fermented salsa and fermented burdock root. Visit the link below for a materials list so you can take samples of these medicines home with you.

Visit the website below for more information.

See you Sunday for the #BestSundayEver!

"Ever wanted to get into film photography? Well, now's your chance!

I have an immaculate Pentax ME Super for sale today. The camera comes with everything you'd need to become an expert 'amateur photographer'. Here is everything it comes with:

Camera:
Pentax ME Super 35mm camera body w/ retro strap (only 20 or so rolls of film ever ran through the camera)

Lenses:
Pentax-Asahi 50mm manual lens (the lens that came with the camera originally)
Beston 28mm wide-angle lens (great for capturing lots of stuff from a close angle)
Beston 80-205mm Macro zoom lens (awesome for landscape photography)

Filters:
Sears +4 zoom filter (52mm)
Sears Polarizing filter (52mm)
Sears Skylight 1A filter (52mm)
Kalimar haze filter (49mm)
TriStar filter set (for making shapes and other effects with the lenses)

The camera comes with all manuals, and an awesome carrying case. Everything fits inside the case, except for the zoom lens, but that comes with a carrying case of its own! Asking $135 for the set, but I am flexible. Just don't lowball me like crazy! Overall, the camera, lenses, and filters are all in amazing shape, and well worth the $135. Everything is there for you to start doing photography right when you buy the camera, just buy film!"	"2014-04-25T23:00:28+0000"	"Forrest Hicks"

"More unique Christmas gifts!!

All very rare, vintage, and working lighted signs!

Vintage Bud Light sign with rotating background ""confetti"" lights.  Old enough to still have the original red instead of the now blue label on the bottle.  The colored lights in the background are constantly changing in this made to last vintage sign.  $95

Vintage MGD sign with revolving words around the center MGD globe.  This sign comes with a made in ballast and adds in a great appeal to any man cave. Very, very hard to find and made to last.  $80

Budweiser backlit sign.  King of Beers as we all know. This sign is made to light up the wall behind it, putting a spotlight on that special piece we all have hanging on our walls.  I was unable to find another replicate of this one online.  $50

He can be skittish so it is best that rather than trying to catch him you first call the number listed so that we may come get him ourselves before he runs off again. My dad is especially broken up about this (we've had this dog for 9 years), and it would really mean the world to us to get him home safely as soon as possible."

"As many people know, I love to crochet (especially headbands)! Recently I decided to try and sell the huge amount of headbands I have been making. 
While this worked out pretty well, I realized that my skills could be put to better use. Instead of choosing yarn myself, making the headband, and selling it, I have decided to do something different. 
I want to donate all the extra headbands to the local women's shelter during this cold winter season. However, since I am a broke student, buying all the yarn is not really an option. 
What I am now trying to propose to everyone is if you would like one of my handmade crocheted bow-tie headbands, go to Joanns or Fred Meyer, buy the color yarn you'd like and bring it to me. I will make you a headband with the yarn, and use the rest of it for headbands to donate! 
If this sounds like something you would like to do, message me and let me know! There are certain types of yarn that works better than others for crocheting, let me know if you have any questions (:

"Looking to sell my old iPhone 4. It is black, and in great condition. I used it for a year or two before upgrading to a different phone. No scratches or chips visible.

It is the 8 gb version, I never used the full memory with loads of apps and pictures.
I've wiped all the data off of the phone and reset to factory defaults, just like if you bought it from the store. It should be unlocked for any carrier or just used offline without service, whatever you want.
Comes with a charger for the phone.

I'm asking $150 for it but I'm open for negotiation. Considering models of this phone that are unlocked run somewhere in the 200s, I think that this is a bargain.

Sorry for the low-quality pictures, but you get the idea.

"AWESOME BIKE!!!! 450$ OBO
This bike is sweet, i am a part time bike mechanic and i take good care of my things. This bike was bought new and has had just one owner this bike has had lots of love and was a project/hobby bike for a year and had nearly everything you could upgrade on it, upgraded. Size: 18.5''

List of upgrades:
1.)Mavic Crossmax 26inch Wheel Set
2.)Maxxis Holy Roller 26 tires
3.)Avid BB7 Disk 6 inch Breaks
4.)Jagwire Ripcord Cables
5.)Raceface Handle Bars
6.)DH/AM heavy Duty Stem
7.)Lizard Skin handlebar Grips
8.)Rock Shox Psylo 80-125mm Front Fork W/ U-Turn adjustment and on the Fly lockout
9.)WTB Ride Soft Gel Saddle
10.)Salsa 9mm Skewers
11.)Sram Quick Link Chain
12.) Shimano SLX Duel Trigger Front Derailer

This bike is really awesome and i am sore to see it go, but i dont get a chance to use it often enough to justify keeping this off the trail. This bike could be used as a trail bike or something like a trials/urban adventure bike. Perfect for riding Galbraith Mountain or the Interurban Trail or commuting to and from work. Honestly my favorit part of the bike is the rear hub and the strong pulls inside it, sounds like a swarm of bees are chasing you. :)

Look at them here: http://pinterest.com/jswhatnow/sell/

The mini-fridge was hardly used, although it was in my room for 9 months. Originally bought for $220. Asking price: $100 [non-negotiable]
